Project Description
SHE (Spark Her Empowerment) is a comprehensive digital platform dedicated to empowering women through skill development, mentorship, and career opportunities. The platform provides personalized learning paths, connects women with expert mentors, and facilitates job placements through an integrated ecosystem of courses, assessments, and recruiter connections.


The Problem statement
Women, especially from underserved communities, face significant barriers in accessing quality education, professional mentorship, and job opportunities. Traditional learning platforms lack personalized guidance, while mentorship programs are often expensive and inaccessible. Additionally, women re-entering the workforce after career breaks struggle to find opportunities that match their updated skill sets.


The Solution
SHE addresses these challenges through:

Personalized Skill Assessment: AI-driven tests that evaluate current skills and recommend customized learning paths

Diverse Course Catalog: Free and affordable courses in high-demand fields (tech, business, creative arts)

Expert Mentorship: Direct connection with industry professionals for guidance and support

Job Matching: Intelligent job recommendations based on completed courses and skill assessments
Technical Details
Technologies/Components Used
For Software:

Languages used: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Frameworks used: Flask, Jinja2, SQLAlchemy, Flask-Login

Libraries used: Werkzeug, Flask-SQLAlchemy, datetime, os, re

Tools used: VS Code, Git, SQLite
For Hardware:

Main components: Standard laptop or desktop computer, Web browser (Chrome / Firefox / Edge)

Specifications: Python 3.8 or higher, Minimum 4GB RAM, 500MB free disk space, Internet connection (for loading Google Fonts)

Tools required: Python 3.8+, pip (Python package manager), Git (optional, for cloning the repository), Any modern web browser
Features
Here's a brief summary of all the features of the SHE platform:

👩 For Women Learners
Skill Assessment — A short quiz when you first sign up that checks your education, interests, and computer skills to personalise your learning path.
Explore Courses — Browse 16+ courses made for women across categories like Bakery, Stitching, Coding, Fashion, Beauty, and more. Filter by category or level to find what suits you.
My Courses — Your personal learning page. Shows courses taught by your mentor separately at the top, and all your other enrolled courses below. Every course has a progress bar so you can see how far you've come.
Mentor Selection — Browse verified mentors, see their expertise and what subjects they teach, and send them a mentorship request in one click.
Mentor Chat — Chat directly with your mentor from inside each course. The chat opens with a personalised greeting based on the course you're studying, so help is always in context.
Job Board — View job listings posted by recruiters and apply to ones that match your skills — all from within the platform.
Certificates — Finish a course 100% and a certificate is automatically issued to you.

👩‍🏫 For Mentors
Mentor Dashboard — See your active mentees and how many new requests are waiting for you.
Request Management — Accept or decline mentorship requests from women learners with one click.
Teaching Profile — Your name and subjects are shown to students on their My Courses page, so they always know who is guiding them and what you teach.

🧑‍💼 For Recruiters
Post Jobs — Create a job listing with title, description, location, requirements, and salary range.
View Applicants — See everyone who applied to your job with their details.
Application Status — Mark applicants as shortlisted, rejected, or hired.

🔐 Security
Passwords are hashed and never stored as plain text. Every page checks your role before letting you in. Sessions are managed securely with Flask-Login.
